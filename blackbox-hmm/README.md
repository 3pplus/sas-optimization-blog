# Improving Hidden Markov Models with Black-Box Optimization

This folder contains two CASL codes files that implement HMMs initial values tuning using Black-Box optimization solver for two datasets. The data folder contains the two training datasets and some data files for imposing linear constraints on the tuning variables. 


## Hidden Markov Models

An extension of Markov models to the case where the observation is a probabilistic function of the hidden states. It has rich applications in Finance, NLP, Computer Vision, e.g., stock price prediction and speech recognition.

## Black-Box optimization solver

A Hyperparameter tuning approach for complex models. It supports Black-Box functions/constraints, tuning integer/continuous/categorical variables, and
parallel global and local search.
